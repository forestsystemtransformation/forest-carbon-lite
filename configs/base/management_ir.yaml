# Management effects on forest parameters
effects:
  y_multiplier: 1.5            # 50% growth improvement
  mortality_factor: 0.5        # 50% mortality reduction
  disturbance_factor: 0.3      # 70% disturbance reduction
  prescribed_burn_effect: 0.2  # 20% biomass consumption from frequent burns
  apply_to_reforestation: true # Enable management effects for reforestation scenarios

# Management practices
