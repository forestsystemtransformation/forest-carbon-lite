# Management effects on forest parameters
effects:
  y_multiplier: 1.5            # 50% growth improvement
  mortality_factor: 0.5        # 50% mortality reduction
  disturbance_factor: 0.3      # 70% disturbance reduction
  prescribed_burn_effect: 0.2  # 20% biomass consumption from frequent burns
  apply_to_reforestation: true # Enable management effects for reforestation scenarios

# Management practices
practices:
  prescribed_burning: "Very frequent (3 year intervals)"
  thinning: "Intensive for maximum growth"
  species_mixing: "Climate-adapted species with genetic diversity"
  pest_control: "Integrated pest management with monitoring"
  fire_management: "Advanced fuel management and fire breaks"
  climate_adaptation: "Species selection and assisted migration"
  carbon_monitoring: "Continuous carbon stock monitoring"
  reforestation_management: "Active management of reforestation areas"
  scope: "Applied to both existing standing forest AND reforestation sites"
