description: "Moderate AFM - Applied to standing forest only. Climate adaptive interventions with maximum improvements to existing forest."
display_name: "Moderate AFM (Standing Forest)"

# Management effects on forest parameters
effects:
  y_multiplier: 1.35           # 35% growth improvement
  mortality_factor: 0.65       # 35% mortality reduction
  disturbance_factor: 0.5      # 50% disturbance reduction
  prescribed_burn_effect: 0.15 # 15% biomass consumption from frequent burns

# Management practices
practices:
  prescribed_burning: "Frequent (5 year intervals)"
  thinning: "Intensive for resilience"
  species_mixing: "Climate-adapted species"
  pest_control: "Integrated pest management"
  fire_management: "Advanced fuel management"
  climate_adaptation: "Species selection for future climate"
