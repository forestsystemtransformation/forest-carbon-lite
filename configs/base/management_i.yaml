name: "i"
description: "Intensive AFM - Applied to standing forest only. Maximum intervention with intensive forest management of existing forest."
display_name: "Intensive AFM (Standing Forest)"

# Management effects on forest parameters
effects:
  y_multiplier: 1.5            # 50% growth improvement
  mortality_factor: 0.5        # 50% mortality reduction
  disturbance_factor: 0.3      # 70% disturbance reduction
  prescribed_burn_effect: 0.2  # 20% biomass consumption from frequent burns

# Management practices
practices:
  prescribed_burning: "Very frequent (3 year intervals)"
  thinning: "Intensive for maximum growth"
  species_mixing: "Climate-adapted species with genetic diversity"
  pest_control: "Integrated pest management with monitoring"
  fire_management: "Advanced fuel management and fire breaks"
  climate_adaptation: "Species selection and assisted migration"
  carbon_monitoring: "Continuous carbon stock monitoring"
  scope: "Applied to existing standing forest only - no reforestation"
